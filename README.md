## Dataset
 Airbnb provides open data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities; and also provides a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals. By analyzing publicly available information about a city’s Airbnb’s listings, Inside Airbnb provides filters and key metrics so we can see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market. Airbnb has seen a meteoric growth since its inception in 2008 with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year.
